Part1
Create an object name “object1” and use script file name “print” to print the position, rotation and keyframe value in the console window:
 
  
So This script file can be placed under any object to load their position and transform value, but I only used it on one object to demonstrate the effect.
Then animation file( end with.anim file) is created to store the animation of other objects
 
Creative Feature: Use UModeler to create individual model.
 
Using Umodeler create a helicopter from sketch with animation.
